## The Thought Process:

This project aims to protect individuals from Phishing attacks, specifically AI-generated attacks. A phishing attack is implemented by a malicious person acting as a reputable organization or person. These attacks usually implement some urgency, time commitment, or praying on non-tech-savvy persons. Misspellings, false emails, or fake logos can identify phishing attacks. With the ever-growing advancements of AI, our concern was the improvement in Phishing Attacks. Our theory is: "What if malicious individuals used AI text-generating tools to enhance their phishing attacks?" Thus eliminating the misspelling factor to identify a Phishing email.  

## The Vision: 

Themis proposes to elminate this threat by using AI detection tools utilizing Machine Learning and API tools. We hope to submit screenshot of email
scan email to...

  📍identify real and fake logos

  📍identify real and fake email language

  📍identify real and fake email addressess 

  📍identify if written by AI or human

## MVP Requirements

☑️ Upload Image of Email or Letter from Scammer

☑️ Image recognition of Capital One Logos, 

☑️ Word recognition

☑️ detect if AI genereated or not

☑️ Deliver evaluation: valid or scam with certainty percentage

☑️ contact information to speak to a capital one rep

## The Future
Check if email contents indicates a scam

Cross-reference with verified sources -> is the message signed by an actual representative of Captial One
once verdict is reached, recommend to get in contact with actual representative
be able to take pic of letter and evaluate that as well

Recognize images, videos, and voice messages that were generated using deep fake technology

Create a risk analysis to keep user informed about what personal info has been compromised and is used against them for scams

Automatically create database to collect evidence for law enforcement

# The Thought Process:

This project aims to protect individuals from Phishing attacks, specifically AI-generated attacks. A phishing attack is implemented by a malicious person acting as a reputable organization or person. These attacks usually implement some urgency, time commitment, or praying on non-tech-savvy persons. Misspellings, false emails, or fake logos can identify phishing attacks. With the ever-growing advancements of AI, our concern was the improvement in Phishing Attacks. Our theory is: "What if malicious individuals used AI text-generating tools to enhance their phishing attacks?" Thus eliminating the misspelling factor to identify a Phishing email.  

# The Vision: 

Themis proposes to elminate this threat by using AI detection tools utilizing Machine Learning and API tools. We hope to submit screenshot of email
